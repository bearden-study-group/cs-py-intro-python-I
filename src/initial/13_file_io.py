Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# f = open("foo.txt")
# # print(f)
# read_file = f.read()
# print(read_file)
# print(f"f.closed ? {f.closed}")

# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
# "w" overwrites everything in file
# "a" appends to end of file
# "x" creates file
# "r" is for reading file
